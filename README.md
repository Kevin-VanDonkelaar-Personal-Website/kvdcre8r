# Kevin VanDonkelaar: The Super Developer

This was the first version of my personal website. It is hosted [here](https://kevin-vandonkelaar-personal-website.github.io/kvdcre8r/). I developed it using HTML and CSS. The most recent version can be found [here](https://the-super-developer.netlify.app/).

I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I did creating it. Thank you!
