<!-- CAREER SIMULATION: PERSONAL WEBSITE -->

Create - Develop - Inspire

I have adopted these three simple concepts as my motto as I embark on my new career as a web developer. My goal with this website is to display each of these in a tangible way. 

First, I used the comic book theme to show some of my personality and display my creativity. Second, I researched techniques and added extra features above the requirements to display my growing ability as a web developer. And lastly, I shared some of my personal info to inspire others.

I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I did creating it. Thank you.
